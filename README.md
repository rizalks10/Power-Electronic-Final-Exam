## 📘 Overview

This repository presents the final examination project for the Power Electronics course. The assignment is separated into two primary sections:

- **Task 1:** Design and analyze MOSFET switching.  
- **Task 2:** Design and analyze three inverter topologies commonly used in power electronics.

**Project Description**

This project involves developing both simulation and experimental setups to investigate the switching behavior of a power MOSFET under a resistive load. The task includes designing a low-side totem-pole gate driver, implementing it in simulation and laboratory testing, and evaluating how gate-driver characteristics influence MOSFET switching performance.

The project aims to assess understanding of switching transients, gate-driver design principles, MOSFET dynamic behavior, and the measurement and interpretation of switching waveforms.

**Observation**

The study requires performing simulations and experiments on MOSFET switching and recording the following waveforms:

1. Gate-source voltage V<sub>GS</sub>(t) 
2. Drain current  i<sub>D</sub>(t)  
3. Drain-source voltage V<sub>DS</sub>(t)

Key switching parameters to be identified and annotated include:

- Delay time  
- Rise time  
- Turn-on plateau  
- Fall time  
- Turn-off plateau  
- Any overshoot or oscillation resulting from parasitic effects

## 🔍 Task 2: Three Inverter Topologies Commonly Used in Power Electronics

**Project Description**
This task involves analyzing three converter topologies that are widely applied in power electronics:

- Half-bridge single-phase inverter (Figure 3)  
- Full-bridge single-phase inverter (Figure 4)  
- Three-phase inverter (Figure 5)

The study examines the influence of sinusoidal pulse-width modulation (SPWM), dc-link voltage, and modulation index on inverter output performance. A second-order filter is also designed to obtain the desired output voltage quality.

This task evaluates understanding of inverter operation, modulation strategies, harmonic behavior, and LC filter design.
